## This project contains 2 modules; ~~Self-Driving~~ and Object detection

Self-Driving part still not success. The latest work collecting data by 66x200 in YUV format for 500k images (25 GB). Driving from Miami -> Newyork and Los Angeles -> Las Vegas (In game).
And Nvidia Pilotnet for DL model. Possibly need to find another way to deal with bias data or re-collecting with other format and new modeling (Transfer learning ?).
Will revisit later.
